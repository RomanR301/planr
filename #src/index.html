        <div class="section-description grey-text">You know how it goes in business: scheduling and capacity planning
          is often very timeconsuming. Many tools do not quite meet the needs of your company, are not flexible enough
          and the output is confusing. But it is precisely the planning and monitoring that lays the decisive foundation
          for the successful completion of your projects.
          <br>
          This is why PLANR was developed: The software that exceeds your requirements and largely takes over your
          planning.
